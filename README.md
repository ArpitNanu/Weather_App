# Weather_App
A simple web application to display the current temperature and weather conditions for any user-entered location.
In the world of AI where tools like a cursor, windsurfer, and other AI co-pilots why should even build a simple weather that can done by a simple prompt yes prompt engineering is a job because everything begins from a simple hello world.
Why should I even build this, why shouldn't I just start learning ML/AI, why shouldn't just get better at English to write better prompts, why did my ex talk to my girlfriend, etc?
Building a weather app taught me how HTML interacts with CSS. how can I select different elements <p>, <h1>, different classes, different IDs, and what the hell is nth-child?         
how can to select elements, classes, and id in JavaScript (which makes you later appreciate Reactjs?
how does DOM manipulation work? how can select input box text innerHTML vs innerText? what e.preventdeafault do?
why should we async when I am calling api weather api?
how to destruct the weather JSON response? what is JSON and why it's preferred? how is it different from JS objects? Ahh key: value pair.
these are just basic prompts I wrote to Geimni because introverts like me like AI, ask all the dumb questions.
Now wait stop close your eyes what the hell did you just read just a bunch of stupid questions in your head?
Yes and no let's just look at the bigger picture.
I think of these questions yes my friend thinks about what still AI can't do which helped me build a basic with following tutorial hell.
come on we all lived in the guilt pleasure of tutorial hell.
learned how to write better prompts, and I learned the flow of javascript, so next just ask AI to write the weather for me so I can focus on building an App for better grooming my dog. 
yes thought of dog grooming according to the weather forecast and changing diet plans for them.

I'm also scared like you all because of AI and these buzzwords. Only to focus to learn fast, build fast, move fast, and start thinking about  your Users.
yes, apple, google, amazon, etc are always focusing on users, not your stack. if your product sucks acc to users even if it's written in c or Rust or Go. it sucks. Bye
